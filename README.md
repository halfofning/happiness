# World Happiness Analysis ‚ú®

## Context
The happiness scores and rankings are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question asks respondents to think of a ladder with the *best possible life for them being a 10* and the *worst possible life being a 0* and to rate their own current lives on that scale.

The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of **six factors ‚Äì economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity** ‚Äì contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world‚Äôs lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

## Problem Statement
Knowing from the sample dataset (2016) listing the happiness scores of representatives in each country and the factors that contribute to these scores, **how accurate can we predict the happiness scores of each country in 2017?**
